# Hi there! I'm Mohamed Gehad Hussien! 👋

I'm a second-year student at Zagazig University studying Computers and Systems Engineering. I really enjoy tech stuff, coding, and exploring new things in computer engineering.

## About Me ℹ️

I love learning and solving real-life problems with technology. I'm interested in various areas of computer engineering like making software, designing systems, and working with embedded systems.

## Projects 🚀

Here are a few cool projects I've worked on:

- [Doodle Jump](https://github.com/K4rimCraft/DoodleJump): A version of the classic game DoodleJump using Java and the JavaFX Library.
- [Resto](https://github.com/K4rimCraft/Restaurant-App): I made the user interface for managing an online restaurant store.
